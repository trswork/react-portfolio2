        Hello. My name is Tenee Rodriguez. I am currently based in Charlotte NC. I am attending UNCC's Coding Bootcamp with the intent of completing this course in January of 2022. Coding is a new field for me. I've spent the last 6 years in the Insurance field. I have experience with both personal and commercial insurance.
